% PULSESEQUENCER M-file for PulseSequencer.fig
%      PULSESEQUENCER, by itself, creates a new PULSESEQUENCER or raises the existing

%
%      H = PULSESEQUENCER returns the handle to a new PULSESEQUENCER or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      PULSESEQUENCER('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in PULSESEQUENCER.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      PULSESEQUENCER('Property','Value',...) creates a new PULSESEQUENCER or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before EditSequence_OpeningFunction gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to PulseSequencer_OpeningFcn via varargin.
